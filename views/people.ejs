            <h2>Gandalf the Grey</h2>
            <p>Gandalf the Grey (also known as Mithrandir and Ol√≥rin) is a wise wizard who was sent to Middle-Earth around year
                1000 in the Third Age, more than 2000 years before the setting of The Lord of the Rings, to help the free
                peoples fight the evil Sauron, along with Saruman the White (who later abandoned his task) and three other
                wizards. Gandalf befriended many peoples and became a well-known name all over Middle-Earth. In the year
                3018 Gandalf was selected to lead the Fellowship of the Ring. After defeating the evil Balrog of Moria, Gandalf
                the Grey died and ressurected as Gandalf the White, and continued fighting Sauron. When Sauron was defeated,
                Gandalf left Middle-Earth and went over the sea, where he had come from.</p>

            <h3>Aragorn, King of Men</h3>
            <p>Aragorn II was the son of Arathorn and Gilraen, and an only child. He was born on March 1st, 2931 of the Third
                Age, he was the thirty-ninth generation of the heirs of Isildur. Aragorn was only two years old when his
                father died, so his mother took him to live in Rivendell. There, he was given the name Estel to hide his
                true identity and heritage because Sauron was searching to see if any heir of Isildur lived. Estel often
                went out into the wild with Elrond's sons, Elladan and Elrohir. One day they returned, and it was said that
                Estel had done great things. Elrond decided that it was the time to tell him his true heritage. Elrond gave
                to Aragorn the tokens of his house, the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil.</p>

            <h4>Gimli, Son of Gloin</h4>
            <p>Gimli is the son of Gloin, who was one of Bilbo's companions on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from
                the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent. Gimli was deemed too young to go on that journey, but 77 years later would
                find himself traveling with Bilbo's adopted heir, Frodo Baggins, on a quest of much greater importance.</p>
